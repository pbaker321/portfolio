# Peter Baker Portfolio Project

This a project for the CodeInstitute. The aim is to create a static front end website using all the technologies we have used so far.

# UX

This a beginner full stack developer website. The aim of the site is to promote the developer for future employment and potential projects.

The website will consist of a fully responsive 4 page site, using a standard layout across all pages. Navigation is clear and easy to use across the header of the page. In tablet or mobile form it will become a dropdown navbar. 

## As a Visitor

- To easily understand what the page is about.
- To straight away visually see what the developer is capable of.
- To be able to navigate my way through the website and easily return to previously visited pages without using the back key.
- To be able to see and download the developers CV without leaving the site.
- To be able to view the developers projects to date.
- To be able to contact the developer and give as much information as needed.

# MVP

The Website will consist of 4 pages and a link to a CV.

## There will be:

- Home/Landing page. Which contain information about the developer
- Resume. Contains education & work history. Developers skills
- Portfolio. A page with links to the developers projects. 
- CV. Downloadable cv 
- Contact. A form to contact the developer for future projects or employment.
